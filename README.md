# Keep-Root
Specifically for realme 11 pro series but can work with any a/b devices.
It can retain root in the following conditions 
1. Updating OTA
2. Flashing custom recoveries ie TWRP
3. Update Magisk to newer version.
4. Changing from Magisk Root to APatch Root system***.
5. Update APatch.***
   It doesn't need PC
   It's noob friendly
   It's only need termux.
