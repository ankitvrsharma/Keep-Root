# Keep-Root
Specifically for realme 11 pro series but can work with any A/B devices.
It can retain root in the following conditions:-
1. Updating OTA
2. Flashing custom recoveries ie TWRP
3. Update Magisk to newer version.
4. Changing root system from magisk to other magisk variants, to APatch or vice versa.
   It doesn't need PC
   It's noob friendly
   It's only need termux.
